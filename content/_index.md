# CSGS @ UofT | Hello, world!

We are the Computer Science Graduate Society (CSGS), representing graduate students studying computer science at the University of Toronto. We serve as your liason to voice your opinions and suggestions to the department. 

We also host once in awhile events for graduate students like pub nights, mentorship mix-and-mingle, movie nights, and board game nights. We have weekly gatherings like cookie breaks where graduate students can meet each other (outside of their labs).
